## About

**HTMX Profile Picture Maker** Is a tool that helps you turning your profile picture into an htmx lasered one, because:

1. Why not?
1. Haven't you done it already?
1. It's very cool!

_Note: this is a fling project that will die in a while so don't get your hopes up._

## Technologies used

- Go
- Rust
- Yew (I'm on a no-JS streak, Yew was my only non-JS frontend option, and it's really growing on me)
- Cairo Graphics
- I was very close to adding C into the mix up, but then I remembered that a cairo wrapper for Go exists!

## Contributing

IDK, it would be really nice of you to contribute, check the poorly written [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.

### Roadmap

- [x] Create a somewhat usable frontend
- [x] Create the backend that will do the actual work
- [ ] Refine how the frontend looks, something
- [ ] Add more roadmap items
- [ ] Refactor the code (never gonna happen)
